<p>My name is Bodecker DellaMaria, or Bo for short. I am a software engineer at <a href="http://workday.com">Workday</a> in San Francisco. I previously studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois.</p>

<p>I am originally from Crystal Lake, IL but I enjoy traveling and have lived in a variety of other locations including Barcelona, Seattle, and Boulder Junction, Wisconsin. I have interned in technical roles with companies such as Microsoft and Yahoo.</p>

<p>Some of the things I am most passionate about are music, technology, and entrepreneurship. I hope that my career will tie these together someday.</p>
