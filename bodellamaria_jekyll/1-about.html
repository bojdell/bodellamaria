<p>My name is Bodecker DellaMaria, or Bo for short. I am a senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, and after graduation I plan on working as a software engineer on the west coast of the United States.</p>

<p>I am originally from Crystal Lake, IL but I enjoy traveling and have lived in a variety of other locations including Barcelona, Seattle, and San Francisco. I have interned in technical roles with companies such as Microsoft and Yahoo.</p>

<p>Some of the things I am most passionate about are music, technology, and entrepreneurship. I hope that my career will tie these together someday.</p>
