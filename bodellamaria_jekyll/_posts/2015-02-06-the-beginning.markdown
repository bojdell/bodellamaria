Recently, I participated in the UIUC Technology Entrepreneurship Center's Silicon Valley Workshop. I’ve been to the area many times, but this trip really opened my eyes to a side of the Bay I had never seen before. It was an incredible experience.

One of the many unique opportunities that TEC provides the Illinois community, the Silicon Valley workshop is a week-long tour that exposes students to entrepreneurial alumni and startups in the Bay Area. The selection process includes an online application and in-person interviews, after which 30 students are chosen each year to participate in the program. I had applied the past few years without being accepted, so I was very excited to finally have the chance to attend as a senior.

Our journey kicked off in San Jose, where we visited locations in the South Bay such as MalwareBytes, NetSpeed Systems, Bloom Energy, and Andreessen Horowitz. When we moved to San Francisco midway through the week, we stopped by some of the more urban sites including Square, The Giant Pixel Corporation, Yelp, Bloc.io, and Uber.

The TEC coordinators did a fantastic job of packing the days with an ambitious and diverse schedule - each stop gave us a totally different perspective about what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur and how to go about building sustainable businesses. It was hard to keep track of everything, but below are a few of the most important lessons that stuck with me:

+ **Build a network.** You can accomplish amazing things if you have access to the right team and the right mentors.

+ **Don’t plan too far into the future.** Time spent planning long-term success is time wasted - take the best opportunities as they come to you and let things unfold. Your life may take an unexpected path towards the ultimate goals you want to achieve.

+ **Learn how to tell a story.** If you want to go above and beyond the average entrepreneur, you have to be able to captivate people with a good story.

+ **Be honest with yourself and what you want.** Life is short - don’t waste it building someone else’s dream.

Aside from learning so much and connecting with alumni, one of the priceless things about the trip was growing close with the other participants. Many of us came from varying backgrounds - some studying engineering, others finance or agriculture, some were freshmen or sophomores, while others were wrapping up graduate degrees. These distinct viewpoints made for great discussions, since everyone had something unique to contribute. We spent a lot of time getting to know each other and bonding over the course of the trip, and I have no doubt that many of these friendships  will stay with us for life.

The workshop was a great opportunity for us all, and I really felt fortunate to have the chance to experience it before leaving college. It's clear that Silicon Valley is still the place to be for entrepreneurs interested in working hard and leaving an impact on the world. Can't wait to get back out there!
