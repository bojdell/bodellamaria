<p>Recently, I participated in the UIUC Technology Entrepreneurship Center trip to Silicon Valley. I’ve been to the area many times, but this trip really opened my eyes to a side of the Bay I had never seen before. It was incredible to hear the speakers open up to us, sharing stories, dreams, and advice on not just how to build a successful company and career, but also how to get the most out of living life as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>The program took place over the last week of our winter break (which, in college lasts basically an entire month), so by the time we assembled on the west coast most of us were ready for a little bit of excitement. Our journey kicked off in San Jose, and we’d pile on the bus early each morning, spending the whole day visiting a variety of companies and alumni. In the evenings we’d have some free time to explore the area or just chill in the hot tub (which we did frequently).</p>

<p>The TEC coordinators did a fantastic job of packing the schedule with an ambitious and diverse set of events - from inventors to investors, recent college grads to seasoned leaders in tech - we got to meet a ton of people over the span of just six days, and it was awesome.</p>



<p>By the end of the trip, we had learned so much it was hard to make sense of it all. A few of the most important lessons that stuck with me were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build a network: You can accomplish amazing things if you have access to the right team and the right mentors.</li>
	<li>Don’t plan too far into the future: Time spent planning long-term success is time wasted - take the best opportunities as they come to you and let things unfold. Your life may take an unexpected path towards the ultimate goals you want to achieve.</li>
	<li>Learn how to tell a story: If you want to go above and beyond the average entrepreneur, you have to be able to captivate people with a good story.</li>
	<li>Be honest with yourself and what you want: Life is short - don’t waste it building someone else’s dream.</li>
</ul>
