Today officially marks my first day of work at [Workday](http://www.workday.com/)! I’ve been very eager for this day to come, and I couldn’t be more excited for this fantastic opportunity. Even though the path to get here was a bit rough (I’ll write a follow-up post about that), it has made today that much sweeter.

Looking forward to learning, growing, and contributing lots in this new experience. Thanks to everyone who helped me get here.
