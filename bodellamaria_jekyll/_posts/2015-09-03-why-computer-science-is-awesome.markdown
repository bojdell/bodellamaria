For the last few weeks, I've been working on a video to for the AP Computer Science teacher at my old high school. He's been trying to grow the program, adding courses and technologies to the curriculum, and when he heard that I started a full time software job in SF, he asked me to put together a video to try and get high school kids excited about computer science.

<div style="margin: auto; width: 60%; text-align: center;"><iframe style="margin-bottom: 15px;" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4NE3-3Poj8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>

Having very fond memories of my days in AP Comp Sci, I was happy to help out, but actually making the video proved to be a lot harder than I expected! My initial strategy was to get a bunch of little clips of me in cool places (the office, Dolores Park, Tahoe, etc.) talking about CS and then edit them together into a larger video. I didn't get more than a few shots in before I realized that I didn't have the skills or time to produce such a complex masterpiece.

My second go at it was a bit more practical, but still didn't quite work out. I tried just freestyling my thoughts in front of my computer's webcam. I took some notes beforehand, but it's surprisingly hard to talk straight into a camera for as long as I did without sounding awkward or boring...

So finally, I decided to get back to the basics and make a good ole slideshow. It ended up being a great way to stay focused during the video, and it also allowed me to incroporate some of the visuals I had previously planned on implementing. The only downside was I couldn't figure out a good way to fit my webcam recording into it, so it turned out a bit like a colorful webinar. But, it was a lot better than the first 2 results, so I did a few takes and sent along the best one.

Anyways, I have no idea if the video will be interesting (especially to a bunch of high schoolers), but I tried to keep it unique and optimistic. I'm planning on participating in Code.org's [Skype in the Classroom](https://education.skype.com/computerscience) project, so I suppose this will be good practice for that!

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions, comments, or other feedback! I'd love to hear it.
