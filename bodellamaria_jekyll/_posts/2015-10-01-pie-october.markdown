Now that I’m mostly settled in at home and at work, I’d like to start making time for a few things that I always wanted to do once I had a more structured schedule. To borrow a technique recently used by my friend [D.J. Podgorny](https://djpodgorny.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/my-project-for-individual-excellence-pie/) and originally inspired by [Zak Slayback’s blog](http://zakslayback.com/2015/03/18/pie-project-for-individual-excellence), I’d like to call it a Project of Individual Excellence, or PIE for short (sounds tasty, I know right?).

Basically I picked out three medium-term goals for myself that I will be achieving over the month of October. Theses are all things I wished I had done in college and dreamed about doing once I graduated. I decided to focus on three categories to start - Physical, Creative, and Intellectual:

##Physical

####Go to bed early (9pm weeknights, 12am weekends)

I have never been a morning person, but I like the idea of getting up early and having a head start on the day. I don’t get enough sleep as it is, usually because I lose track of time in the evenings and end up staying awake too late. I think the best way to get better at waking up early is to go to bed early, so I’m going to try and go to bed “early” for the next month.

My target bedtimes are: 9am on weeknights (Sunday - Thursday), 12am on weekends (Friday & Saturday). It might not seem early to some people, but for me that shifts my entire sleep cycle roughly a whole 2 hours earlier. As part of this effort to get to bed earlier, I will set an alarm on my phone daily for 30 minutes prior to my target bedtime to remind me to start getting ready. Also, I have purchased an alarm clock that I can use to wake up, so I will leave all other electronics out of my bedroom. I will log my bedtimes each night to see how I am doing.
**Output: Sleep log of bedtimes.**

##Creative

####Record 1 song each week

I used to perform music all the time - playing in piano recitals, soloing in jazz band, getting up on stage at talent shows. But in college, this habit of putting myself out there went away, and I barely ever played in front of other people. It’s not just about the music (although I do love music) - it’s more about pushing myself to remember what it’s like to perform, as well as conquer the fear of making mistakes in front of others (and minimize them through practice). I’m not an expert musician, heck, I may not be any good after all these years, but I think a lot of the skills honed in this pursuit can translate to other areas of life.
**Output: 1 video each week (4 by the end of the month), posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM_doOFPwfZV04n7ZIip2aA).**

##Intellectual

####Read 3 technical books this month

I love my job. I’m proud of how hard I worked to get here. But at the same time, I’m also humbled by how much of a novice I am at so many things. I know I’m just starting out and most engineers amass their technical expertise over many years of experience. But still, I’m sure that proactively acquiring knowledge can only accelerate this process (not to mention that I genuinely like computers and learning new things). So this month, I will read 3 technical books:
  
  * [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653) (Heavy Read)
  * [Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html) (Medium Read)
  * TBD (potentially The Elements of Scrum, which would be a Light Read)

If time permits, as a bonus I’d like to finish 2 books that I am currently halfway done reading: Scala for the Impatient and Eloquent Javascript, but I'd rather not overcommit!
**Output: I have read 3 technical books.**

My PIE isn’t nearly as intense as D.J.’s was (you go dude!), but I think it will be a good place to start. If things go well, I’d love to circle back with another (potentially more difficult) PIE next month or sometime in the future. Feel free to share any thoughts you have (or tell me about a PIE of your own)!
