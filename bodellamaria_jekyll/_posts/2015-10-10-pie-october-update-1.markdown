One-third done already... The time is flying by! Here's a quick update on how things have been going and some changes I will be making to the challenge.

##Stakes

I will be adding stakes to further motivate me to achieve my goals. For each of the scenarios below I will be donating $5 to [Donald Trump’s presidential campaign](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/):

 - Every night I miss a bedtime
 - Each week I don't record a song
 - Every chapter not read at the end of the month

If I have to donate over $20, these funds will be be applied towards a [tshirt](http://libertymaniacs.com/products/donald-trump-we-shall-overcomb-shirts?variant=3809136513) I must wear to work on Monday 11/2/15. If I exceed the cost of the shirt, all additional funds will be donated directly to Mr. Trump's campaign. Why Trump, you ask? I am not very politically active, but I'm not sure he is what you would call "presidential material". Plus I know local San Franciscans will give me a lot of crap for "supporting" him. Special thanks to Pooja for helping me [brainstorm](http://bodecker.me/2015/10/01/pie-october/#comment-2290392440) such aggresive stakes!

##Physical

####Current status: Bedtimes were on-target every night so far (except maybe 1)

Yes, I have hit my target bedtimes every night so far (woo!), although I was a bit lax one night and interpreted “going to bed” to mean “in my bed”, staying up intentionally reading for another 30-45 minutes… Moving forward I want to try and stay close to the spirit of the goal and actually try falling asleep at the target bedtime. Also I have moved my sleep log to be [electronic](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUX_FZ9SYKq9rpwJHOKTl6Ciz7aZVl2DNeUTYAQrPCc/edit?usp=sharing).

####What I have learned so far:

 - *<u>More sleep does not equate to being less tired</u>* (as my friend Jason Rosselein accurately pointed out when I started the PIE). I actually felt most rested on days when I got the least amount of sleep - waking up early to go for a run, do some work, etc. Days when I let my body sleep in for 9.5 or 10 hours, I felt sluggish waking up. I’m pretty sure this has to do with interrupting my REM cycles though, so I am going to modify the “no technology in the bedroom” part of this goal to allow me to use the [SleepCycle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8) smart alarm to help better sync my wakeups.

##Creative

####Current status: Recorded 2 songs so far!

I should probably mention that the real purpose of this goal is to prepare me for being able to do a set in front of others. I have always wanted to play low-key music in coffee shops, so I am hoping that this will help me to build a foundation for that. My songs (just covers so far) have been uploaded [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpMOT-kVF1Bwwb7KymShJVpg_swe7X3pg).

####What I have learned so far:

 - *<u>Finding good, free software to edit videos is incredibly difficult!</u>* Part of this is due to the world moving to SaaS, but I feel like it’s not that hard to make a free, cheap video editing app only supports basic functionality (I just need to overlay the audio from my phone over the video from my computer’s webcam!). After many hours searching and experimenting with software, I finally stumbled upon the [VideoPad](http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/) editor in the Mac App Store. The UI is pretty outdated, but I love this thing so much because it does exactly what I need it to do!

 - *<u>It’s hard to make progress if you strive for perfection.</u>* I’ve never really thought of myself as a “perfectionist”, but it was surprisingly hard to call a recording “done”. I kept thinking “you can do better than this”, but it got to the point where I was spending too much time trying to nail a perfect recording (and guess what - the versions I chose to post were the first attempts at each song, not follow-up takes). I think there is something to be said for trying to live with a first attempt at something and not allowing yourself a second chance to improve. Sure, if there was some huge flaw in attempt #1, it makes sense to give it another go. But it the first attempt is 85% there, maybe the time spent trying to perfect it isn’t worth it. I have been working on applying this in other areas of my life as well!

##Intellectual

####Current Status: I have read 3 chapters in FP in Scala, and ~1 chapter in Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide

This is probably the goal I am making the least progress on, mostly because I have had other, higher-priority things to take care of during the week.

####What I have learned so far:

 - *<u>Don’t try to rush reading.</u>* Block off time where you can read at an enjoyable pace and leave more time than you think you need!

##Wrap-Up

I’ll be following up around the 20th of October with another update. This next week I am really going to focus on cranking out some serious reading. Thanks to everyone who has been encouraging and supporting me so far!!
