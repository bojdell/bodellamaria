##Physical

####Current status: I have hit my target bedtimes every night so far, except 1

I stayed up late to finish some work one night :/
You can see my sleep logs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUX_FZ9SYKq9rpwJHOKTl6Ciz7aZVl2DNeUTYAQrPCc/edit#gid=0).

I also have given up trying to force myself to sleep if I’m just not tired. If I lay in bed for a while and I’m just not falling asleep, I have started reading my Scala book with a headlamp until I feel ready to fall asleep. It's just not worth 

##Creative

####Current status: Recorded 3 songs so far!

Check them out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpMOT-kVF1Bwwb7KymShJVpg_swe7X3pg)

More coming soon! (This is probably my favorite part of the PIE).

##Intellectual

####Current status: Scala for the Impatient: Halfway done - 150 pages/130, ES: The Definitive Guide: at section 3/8

I have been blocking off a lot of time to read, but these books are really dense… I think I am losing sight of the purpose of this challenge, which was to strengthen my technical skills. Essentially what I have realized is that I am not including enough coding with my reading. 

In the hopes of meeting this goal for my PIE, I was skipping over a lot of the hands-on exercises in FP in Scala. Because of this, I'm not really learning the material as well as I could be if I actually took the time to do some of the exercises. So, in the spirit of actually learning things, I’d like to refine this goal to be:

 - **Updated Goal:** For each chapter / section I read in a technical book, complete at least 5 coding exercises related to it. In the case of FP in Scala, these will be provided for me. In the case of ES: The Definitive Guide, I will create mini-projects myself that use the features I read about.

 - **Updated Stakes:** For each chapter read that I do not complete at least 5 exercises for, I will owe $5 more to Donald Trump. I will host all my mini-projects on GitHub so you an check them out. Also I will not owe anything for remaining chapters I do not read in each book, nor will I be requiring myself to read a 3rd book (I think it's better to focus on these 2 instead of spreading myself too thin).

##Stakes

I currently owe $5 to Donald Trump!

See you at the end of the month...
