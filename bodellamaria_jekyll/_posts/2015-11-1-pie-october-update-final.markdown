##PIE: Project for Individual Excellence

Novermber 1st, the first day I don’t have to go to bed by 9pm, record a song by the end of the week, or worry that I'm not reading enough about programming. Not gonna lie, I was a bit nervous starting off, but in the end, it was all worth it.

Overall, it has been a rewarding and memorable experience to participate in my PIE. I’d like to give a massive thank you to all the people who encouraged and inspired me to take on the challenge this month. It really would not have been possible without you all.

For those who are interested, my two good friends [Sid](http://www.sidsethupathi.com/project-for-individual-excellence/) and [Pooja](https://poojabroad.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/a-slice-of-pie/) are galavanting off on PIEs of their very own starting today. Check em out and cheer them along on their journeys!

How’d my PIE end up, you ask? Let’s find out.

##Lessons Learned

First up, here are some of the most important realizations I will take away from this month:

 - **It’s hard to make progress if you strive for perfection.**
	This was one of the common themes of the month. Trying to get the “best” night of sleep, attempting to record a “flawless” performance, reading with such “focus” that I didn't have to re-read things... Sometimes I got hung up on perfecting the little things that I lost sight of the bigger picture. It is important when you are doing a PIE (and, I guess, anything in life) to constantly ask yourself - “Why am I doing this?”

 - **Technical reading is very different from any other kind of reading.**
	I should have realized that there was a reason it takes students a whole semester to work through a textbook in college. It’s almost impossible to gain deep knowledge of something without taking the time to let yourself digest and apply highly technical concepts firsthand. Unfortunately, I realized that a bit too late in the month, but it will be a valuable insight going forward.

 - **Forced music is not fun music.**
	I got a very small sense this month of what it feels like to make music for a living. Not in the sense that I making any money off it or anything, but the feeling of having “deadlines” (I had to produce at least 4 songs this month) and being constrained by external factors (one week I got sick and I couldn't sing). Even scarier, I started running out of creative juice near the end of the month!

 - **Structure is good, but not without the flexibility to deviate from it when necessary.**
	The cool thing about this whole PIE thing is that it gives focus to your free time. It narrows down the countless possible things you might do to a small set of manageable items. But as with any plan, the desire to adhere to it may weigh against other spontaneous paths that may appear. It’s important to analyze your choices critically and not be afraid to deviate from the plan if the opportunity is great enough.

 - **Meta-learning.**
	It might sound dumb, but I actually learned a lot about how I learn things!

##The Results

###Physical
 - **Original Goal:** Go to bed early (9pm weeknights, 12am weekends)
 - **Performance:** Missed bedtime on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUX_FZ9SYKq9rpwJHOKTl6Ciz7aZVl2DNeUTYAQrPCc" style="text-decoration: underline">3 occasions</a>.
 - **Desired Outcome:** Be less tired during the day due to a consistent sleep cycle, and wake up early enough to do some work in the morning before starting the day.
 - **Actual Outcome:** I was less tired on certain days due to a smart sleep cycle (waking up during light sleep from natural light or SleepCycle alarm). I woke up early enough on many days to perform tasks such as running, doing laundry, answering emails, all while getting to work earlier than I had been previously. Quantity does not equal quality!
 - **Amount Owed to Trump:** $15

###Creative

 - **Original Goal:** Record 1 song each week (4 total)
 - **Performance:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpMOT-kVF1Bwwb7KymShJVpg_swe7X3pg" style="text-decoration: underline">4 songs recorded</a>.
 - **Desired Outcome:** I am more prepared to perform in front of others.
 - **Actual Outcome:** I can play a more diverse repertoire of guitar pieces, and I have a better knowledge of recording / producing live instruments and vocals. I understand that singing well requires a TON of practice and I am not quite ready to sing in a coffee shop. However, my guitar skills are doing alright :)
 - **Amount Owed to Trump:** $0

###Intellectual

 - **Original Goal:** Read 3 technical books this month
 - **Performance:** Almost finished FP in Scala (12/15 chapters), halfway done with ES: The Definitive Guide (3/8 sections), and The Elements of Scrum (2/3 parts).
 - **Desired Outcome:** A deeper understanding of technologies we use at work.
 - **Actual Outcome:** I was reminded how important it is to pair theory with practice. For the first two thirds of October I pushed myself to churn through my books (not “rushing”, but not reading with time to “stop and smell the flowers” either). I attempted to correct my course during my 2nd PIE update, but it was too late. The end of the month was too busy between work and family life (and getting sick), that I didn’t have time to finish the exercises for the reading I was doing. Disclaimer: I am going to adjust my pay scale so I don’t hit the “contribution limit” on Trump’s campaign. I will weight each book based on its “difficulty” I determined at the start of the PIE - $15 for FP in Scala, $10 for ESTDG, and $5 for TOS. These will then be multiplied by the remaining sections/chapters I still need to complete in each book.
 - **Amount Owed to Trump:** ($15 * 3/15) + ($10 * 5/8) + ($5 * 1/3) = $11

Fortunately (or should I say UNfortunately…), $26 ($15 + $11) is roughly the price of an [official shirt](http://shop.donaldjtrump.com/product-p/dtc-ocmt-wh.htm) + $7.50 shipping on Mr. Trump’s campaign webstore. So, when that arrives (along with hopefully not too much negative attention drawn to my apartment), I will be wearing it to work to face the consequences of failing to achieve my goals perfectly.

Do I recommend this exercise to others? Absolutely. Will I try another PIE sometime in the future? Almost certainly. Until then? Check out [Pooja](https://poojabroad.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/a-slice-of-pie/) and [Sid](http://www.sidsethupathi.com/project-for-individual-excellence/)'s projects.

Thanks for reading this far! I'm really grateful for all the support over the past month. Please drop me a note if you have any exciting PIE adventures of your own!
